# Background
This is a code reimplementation about [Graph Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10903v3.pdf) in PyTorch

# Requirement
- PyTorch 1.0
- Python 3.6

# Performances
The epochs in this code are 200 rather than 10000 in the [official repository](https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT). The final accuracy on Cora is between 81.3 and 81.6, slightly below to the accuracy in the paper 83.0.
